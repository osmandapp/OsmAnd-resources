		Deploying your own routing.xml
		==============================
		
		When you finish editing this document (or want to test on your Android device), copy this file over to your device.

		Depending on your device and configuration, this could be one of the following paths:

		sdcard/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files/routing/		(external memory setting, access via computer)
		/storage/emulated/0/Android/data/net.osmand.plus/files/routing/	(external memory setting, access via device itself)
		/data/net.osmand/files/routing/
		/data/user/0/net.osmand.plus/no_backup				(internal memory)
		...
		
		For iOS users, there is no known straightforward way. Please update this documentation if you find one.
		
		Restart OsmAnd (e.g. by swiping it away in the recent app view) to activate the new routing.xml;
		
		Overview of the document
		++++++++++++++++++++++++
	
		The document contains many big blocks, each describing a single profile.
		OsmAnd has three default profiles: car, bicycle and foot.
		
		Some others are described here as well but are hidden by default.
		These profiles can be enabled using the 'OsmAnd development plugin'
		
		## Routing profile 
		
		For starters, a profile can have a few parameter declarations, to finetune the profile:
		
		<parameter name="some_toggle" ... />
		<parameter name="some_other_preference" ... />
		
		(Details on parameters are given later on)
		
		A profile block contains at least the following segments:
		1) access				 (which determines if a road can be taken)
   		2) speed				  (which determines what max speed a road allows)

		A profile block might also contain following segments:
		3) oneway				 (which determines in which direction a road can be taken)
		4) priority			   (which determines how nice the road is to drive on)
		5) obstacle			   (which determines the delay of an obstacle, in seconds for the routing engine)	
		6) obstacle_time		  (which determines the delay of an obstacle, in seconds for the human)
		7) penalty_transition	 (which determines the penalty of transitioning from one highway to another, often a high-level road to a lower level road)


		The routing time of a segment is the sum of values calculated by these blocks, as the following formula indicates:
	
		distance/minimum(maxDefaultSpeed, speed*priority) + height penalty + obstacle penalties + turn penalties + ....
		
		Where `maxDefaultSpeed` is defined by the XML (in the header of the profile), whereas max_speed can be given explicitly by the road or implicitly by law 


		## Block overviews
		
		### 1) Access (specified on ways, obligated, -1 or 1)
		
		Access states whether or not a road _can_ be taken by your mode of transport.
		E.g. a pedestrian is not allowed on a motorway; neither can a car follow a small path.
		
		These values are specified included in a `way`-tag with the attribute `access`:
		
		<way attribute="access">
		
			... statements ...
			
		</way>
		
		Depending on the key-value pairs of a way, a value of either `-1` or `1` is selected.
		`-1` indicates that a road is _not_ accessible
		`1` indicates that the road can be taken
		   
		E.g., for a pedestrian are motorways not allowed:	
		<select value="-1" t="highway" v="motorway"/>
		
		There is no obligation to check against a value. The presence of a key can be enough to check against
		<select value="-1" t="bollard"/>
		
		At last, a default might be given, by not specifying a key:
		<select value="1"/>
		
		The first matching clause is used.
		
			   
		## 2) Speed (specified on ways, obligated, in km/h)
	
		The speed block gives, for each type of road, the maxspeed in km/h.
		If an explicit `maxspeed` tag is given on the way, the default speeds in the `speed` block are ignored.
	   
		
		## 3) Oneway (specified on ways)
	
		The oneway block specifies if the routing should respect the drawing order (direction) or a way.
		In the most simple case, going in both directions is allowed. For these ways, the value "0" is given:
	   
		<select value="0" t="oneway" v="no" />
		
		If the navigation should follow the line in the drawing direction, "1" is the value of choice:
		
		<select value="1" t="oneway" v="1"/>
		
		And if, for some reason, you want to go against the drawing diretion, the value of "-1" should be specified:
		
		<select value="-1" t="oneway" v="-1"/>
			
		
		## 4) Priority (specified on ways, between 0 and 1)
	
		 Priority is a preference multiplicator (between 0 and 1), which can only be used to _de_prioritize routes.
		The default value is 1 (= no effect).
		 The formula used is 
		 `speed_routing = minimum(speed * priority multiplier, maxDefaultSpeed)`;

		The main usage of priority is to discourage certain roads (e.g. based on bad smoothness of the road).
		If a given priority equals `0.5`, the speed will be halved and the road will be discouraged.
		

		On the other hand, a value >1 can be used to promote a route. However, there is an upperbound for this value. The 'speed*priority' can never grow above the maxDefaultSpeed.

	 	For example:
		 The bicycle profile has a maxDefaultSpeed of `33`.
		 The speed on a residential road is `23`.

		Consider that we want to promote this road, because it is marked as a `cycle_street`; and we give it a priority of 2.
		Is this priority of 2 more effective than say 1.5?

		The maximum effective factor is given by `maxDefaultSpeed/speed`, which equals `33/23 = 1.43`.
		In other words, every priority factor bigger than 1.43 has no extra benefit for this case.

		Thus, a factor between 0 and 1 is always effective; but a factor above 1 is not guaranteed to have an effect.



		## 5) Obstacle (specified on points, penalty time in seconds or -1 if blocked)
	
		This block evaluates points encountered on the road.
		The block specifies if this obstacle can be passed and eventually a penalty for passing it.
		
		A value of "-1" is given if the obstacle can not be passed.
		A value of "0" is given if the obstacle can be passed without problem and delay.
		A penalty in seconds is given if the obstacle slows you down (e.g. a kerb might slow down a car and bicycle).
		
		This value is only used by the routing engine.
		
		E.g. a kerb is a showstopper for a wheelchair
		<routingProfile name="wheelchair">
			<point attribute="obstacle>
				<select value="-1" t="barrier" v="kerb" />
			</point>
		</routingProfile>	
		
		
		E.g. a kerb causes a slight delay for cyclists
		<routingProfile name="bicycle">
			<point attribute="obstacle>
				<select value="5" t="barrier" v="kerb" />
			</point>
		</routingProfile>  
		

		## 6) Obstacle_time (specified on points, penalty time in seconds)

		Gives a slowdown time for an obstacle in seconds.
		In contract to `obstacle`, this value is only used to calculate an ETA and show it on the UI once the route is calculated.
		In other words, the values here do not influence routing.
		
		

		## 7) Penalty_transition (specified on ways, penalty time in seconds)

		When driving a car, changing from a motorway to a trunk slows you down:
		you should already slow down 500 meters before the trunk.
		This has a penalty which is taken into account by (only) the navigation algorithm.
		This is done by taking the difference between two penalties.
		The formula used is `maximum(0, penalty_new_way - penalty_current_way)`.
		
		E.g. 
		<way attribute="penalty_transition">
			<select value="0" t="highway" v="motorway"/>
			<select value="5" t="highway" v="motorway_link"/>
			<select value="20" t="highway" v="tertiary"/>
		</way>
				
		This means that, going from a `motorway_link` to a `tertiary`, the penalty given will be
		`maximum(0, 20 - 5)` or `15 seconds`.
		
		On the other hand, going from motorway to motorway incurs no penalty,
		neither does going from a motorway_link to a motorway.


		## 8) obstacle_srtm_alt_speed (specified on ways, in seconds of penalty for each height meter)
	
		Specifies a penalty for steep ways. Optional. Note that the value of a key can be used as value.
		 For more info about this, see the section about parameters.

		E.g.:
  		<gt value1="-60" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="35"/>
  		</gt>
  		<gt value1="-17" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="10"/>
  		</gt>
  		<gt value1="-3" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="1"/>
  		</gt>
  		<gt value1="3" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="0"/>
  		</gt>

  		<gt value1="13" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="8"/>
  		</gt>
  		<gt value1="17" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="1"/>
  		</gt>
  		<gt value1="25" value2=":incline">
  			<select value="10"/>
  		</gt>
  		<select value="15"/>

		has the following meaning:

		-60% and less => 35 seconds per height metre
		[-17% till -60%) => 17 seconds per height metre
		[-3% till -17%) => 1 seconds per height metre
		[3% till -3%) => 0 seconds per height metre
		[3% till 13%) => 8 seconds per height metre
		[13% till 17) => 1 seconds per height metre
		... etc

		A negative select value (seconds per height metre) means "impassable".

		If the incline of a way is 20%, then the penalty per height metre is 10 seconds.
		If the part of the way has for example 9 height meters, then the penalty for this part will be 10*9 = 90 seconds.

				
		## Working with parameters and conditionals
		
		A profile can be tuned further with parameters, to suit the need of each user.
		These toggles could be a preference for a fast route over a comfortable one, the desire to avoid borders, ...
		
		### Declaring parameters
		
		Parameters are declared on top of the routing profile, each in their own tag.
		
		Such a tag could be:		
			<parameter id="some_parameter"	 (The name of the variable. You'll use this a lot.)
				 group="some_group_name"	   (The name the group, used for grouping similar settings in a nice radiobox-UI)
				 name="Some routing option"	(How this is presented to the user)
				 description="This routing options uses this or that feature"
											   (A description that is shown to the user)
				 type="boolean"/>			  (The type of the toggle. Supported values are `boolean` and `numeric`.)
				 
		#### Numeric parameters

		Numeric parameters are declared just as a boolean parameter; but require some additional tags.

		<parameter id="height" name="Height" description="height" 	(Same as boolean tags)
		type="numeric" 						(This is a different type. Who would have guessed it?)
		values="0,1.5,2,2.5,3,3.5,4" 				(The actual values, comma seperated. Floats and ints are allowed)
		valueDescriptions="-,1.5m,2m,2.5m,3m,3.5m,4m		(How each option is shown within the GUI)
		/>

   
		### Setting parameters via OsmAnd UI
		
		The UI of OsmAnd automatically picks up those settings, if this document is deployed.
		Just declaring a boolean option is enough to show a checkbox in the navigation settings.
		
		Toggle the checkbox to see your custom profile in action!
		The appearing extra toggle is also useful to see the activation of your custom routing.xml.
		
		### Using boolean parameters in the routing engine
		
		The boolean options can be tested with an if-tag:
		
		<if param="some_parameter">
			... some select statements ...
		</if>
		
		Analogously, ifnot can be used as well
		
		<ifnot param="some_parameter">
			... selections ...
		</ifnot>
		
		E.g. if you cycle often with a cart, and that cart doesn't like `sett`-pavements, a toggle for this could be added:
		
		<routingProfile name="bicycle" ... >
		
		<parameter id="avoid_sett"
			name="Avoid streets with sett"
			description="Prefers asphalt, paving stones and concrete surfaces. Ideal if driving with a cycling cart"
			type="boolean"/> 
		
		</routingProfile>
		
		### Using numeric parameters in the routing engine   

		Numeric values can be used to compare to other values. For this, a `gt` (greater-then) tag is used.
		The `gt`-tag acts just like an if-test. 
		It will also include the specified number: `<gt value1=":a" value2="3">` means `if parameter a is 3 or higher`

		For example, if the height of your car is set, you'll want to compare it with the `maxheight`-tag given to some ways. This is done with a `gt` tag:

	
		<gt value1=":height" value2="$maxweight" type="height">
			<select value="-1" t="maxweight" />
		</gt>

		To call a value, use either ':' or '$' as prefix. Use ':' for the parameters that you defined
		 and '$' for tags loaded from the obf-file (the file containing the data from OSM).

		The `type` gives a hint on how to parse the values. If the type is `height`, '1' will be interpreted as '1 meter'.
		For a type `weight`, '1' will be interpreted as one ton (1000 kg).
	
		Miscellaneous
		+++++++++++++

		osmand_highway_integrity_brouting represents how good a way is for a bicycle.
		Mostly it merges smoothness, surface and tracktype into one value. It is calculated internally?

		### Alternative notation for <if><select /></if> and <gt><select /></gt>

		A different but equivalent format for if- and gt-tags exists: the <if> can be placed inside a <select>
		However, it is considered bad style (so don't use it).

		In other words:

		<if param="x">
			<select value="..."/>
		</if>

		is totally equivalent to:

		<select value="...">
			<if param="x"/> (Deprecated notation)
		</select>.

		However, we recommend *not to use this format*. The if as outer tags are clearer, and support multiple selects:

		<if param="$x">
			<select value="1" t="y" v="z"/>
			<select value="0" t="w" v="a"/>
			...

            The reason is that you can always dismount and push your bike. Or to put it the other way round:

			<!-- Following lines: I would suggest to change
			the order, according to the following scheme:
			
			1.) First step: Downgrade all the ways that have a really bad
			surface (mud, grade5 etc). Those should be downgraded in any
			case (no matter if path/primary/cycleway/etc). Also, 
			"cobblestone" should already be downgraded here (otherwise,
			it would be ignored too often, for example because it is
			overruled by "bicycle=yes").
			
			2.) Upgrade cycle lanes and cycle tracks. Normally, those are
			paved (great), but they go along main roads, so I suggest a
			factor of 1.6/1.5 (which is already a big upgrade).
			
			3.) Assign a neutral factor to main roads. These are
			normally paved, but often, there is no tag for the surface:
			It makes no sense to upgrade only those main roads that just
			happen to be tagged with paved, asphalt, etc.
			
			4.) Upgrade all tracks, paths etc with a paved surface.
			Very important to do this before "bicycle=yes" (etc).
			Example: In parks, forests or fields, tracks are often
			tagged with bicycle=yes. But only a few tracks are tagged
			as paved. So it is important to check the "paved" first,
			so that paved / asphalt tracks gets a priority. Otherwise, 
			all tracks with bicycle=yes would be treated the same.
			
			5.) Only in "avoid unpaved" mode: Downgrade all paths and tracks
			now, even if they might later be marked bicycle=yes/official/etc.
			
			6.) Upgrade all ways that are tagged bicycle=yes/official etc.
			(this should only be done after the distinction between
			unpaved and paved/asphalt/etc )
			
			7.) Downgrade difficult surfaces such as sand, grass etc. 
			This is done late, because sand / grass are not necessarily
			very bad. A tag like "sand" is often put for compacted surfaces.
			So if a sand way is marked "bicycle=yes" before, it should be good.
			Accordingly, some tags that lead only to a slight upgrade are also
			put here.
			
			8.) Downgrade paths, tracks etc. If up to now, no surface or bicycle
			tag has been detected, the path has a certain risk of having a bad
			surface (we just do not know). To make sure, all smaller ways are
			downgraded now.-->
